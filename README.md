Deforestation monitoring using satellite imaging utilizes satellite images to detect and track changes in forest cover over time.
By employing deep learning models such as Convolutional NeuralNetworks (CNNs) and segmentation models like U-Net, this method can classify and analyze satellite data to identify deforested areas accurately.
The process involves data collection, preprocessing (resizing, normalization), model training (using transfer learning, appropriate loss functions, and optimizers), and evaluation (using metrics like accuracy).
The trained models are then integrated into environmental monitoring systems to enable real-time or batch processing, facilitating timely interventions to prevent illegal logging and habitat destruction.# Repo4
